# Thermal monitoring

The group will want to have at least two weeks of data during the heating season for each space they will be looking at.  What happens in October can be very different from what happens during January.  Session 3 shows how to think about this kind of data in a way that many groups will then be able to pick up on themselves, since many communities contain at least someone with good numeracy skills.  There's probably only time to look at one major space during the sessions themselves, and the monitoring strategy should make sure to get enough data for that space, preferably when it's properly cold. For some groups that will be just before session 3, and for some it might be early in their sessions.  Spring groups might choose to do a version of session 3 without using the monitor data that just considers user behaviours and have the engineer report on later on any other major energy wastes they can see.

For how to choose a good location for the monitor's sensor unit and how to get it working, see the technology guide.

If the group intends to move the monitor around, they'll want to record the locations and when the move happened.  We have a template you can copy for this but you'll need to discuss who will do the moves and enter information in the diary.

```{admonition} Yes, you can keep your monitor
:class: tip

Groups keep asking this. We'd love you to monitor even during the summer, especially if you don't have smart meters.   We've found some of our worst energy wastes that way.  We expect the monitors to continue working until at least July 2024.  After that it's possible we will have to charge a small annual fee for hosting the data, something like the price of a cup of coffee.  

If you don't want the monitor any more, that's a different matter - we're happy to have them back for other groups.
