# Engineer Talk - Session Concepts

This week's engineer talk lays out some basic concepts that it is important for the group to understand, because they affect which of two major paths a community building might take in future.  The talk is about why we heat buildings, and especially, what makes people feel comfortable.  

At the first training session for engineers, we will be showing a couple of ways we could support them giving these talks and ask them what exactly they want us to provide so that they'll feel comfortable with this.  So far, this is the wrong way to provide it, in script form.

## Script form of talk

You will be expecting the programme to be about what to do to your buildings - and it is.  But before we do that, because heating is the biggest use of energy in a community building, we need to talk first about the main reason why we heat buildings, to make people comfortable.

When people feel too cold, the first thing they think about is the air temperature.  Air temperature does matter, but research shows that people are fairly adaptable, as long as the air temperature doesn't vary more than around 2C.  Temperature swings make them uncomfortable even if the temperatures look good, because they need to continually adjust.  This is because within reason, they can adjust their clothing levels.

Air temperature is really only one of six things that affect their thermal comfort.  The average temperature of the surfaces around them - the "mean radiant temperature" - is just as important.  You'll be familiar with how much warmer it feels when the sun comes out.  Modern materials heat up pretty quickly when you turn on central heating, but stone does not.  That means that it's difficult to make a stone building warm and comfortable for occasional use using the kinds of strategies we're used to from homes and offices.  On the other hand, once stone is warm, it stays warm for a long time, which helps in buildings that are occupied a lot, especially at night when the outside temperature drops.  And there are things like infrared panels that operate just like the sun that can help for stone buildings that are infrequently used.  It can also help to put people in direct contact with gentle heating, for instance, with underfloor heating or heated seating.  We need to get more sophisticated in devising strategies for heating our buildings, choosing the right technologies for us.

Along with air temperature and mean radiant temperature, draughts are really important.  They're usually relatively cheap to address, but very often get overlooked.

How humid the air is also makes a difference - one of the most critical things you can do to make a building comfortable is make sure it is watertight so it doesn't get damp. 

The final influence is how active people are.  You can't change what people want to do in your buildings, but you do need to take it into account, because they may need to be able to adjust the heating to suit, and without affecting the next group in.  

These six things - air temperature, radiant temperature, draughts, humidity, activity, and clothing levels - are the main things you need to consider when trying to make people comfortable.  

Thermal comfort is the main reason why we heat our buildings, but it isn't the only one.  We also often heat them to preserve the building.  How much heating they require for this depends on the building's situation, what it is made of, and whether it contains things like oil paintings, and is surprisingly contentious, especially for old buildings.  Damp is the enemy, but heating is a very expensive solution for damp - the most important thing is to keep them water-tight and to make sure the building is well-ventilated, especially after people have been in.  Many community buildings turn the heating on a couple of hours a day for good luck, but a much better approach is to ensure the building never gets so cold that condensation is likely to form inside by bringing the heating on gently just then.  As cheap energy becomes a problem, some building conservationists are starting to suggest that some older buildings may not require heating at all, just careful maintenance.

<!-- :TODO: need to say something in the materials about not letting lots of warm air into a cold stone building because there will then be condensation on the inside - but there really isn't time for this kind of detail! -->

Payback is too slow for heat loss mitigations on a building you don't use often, and it's hard to get grants and donations for infrequently used buildings because the community amenity is less.

Stone buildings are excellent at damping down the extremes in outside temperature - making it cooler inside during the day/in the spring and warmer inside at night/in the autumn than it would be in a more reactive building - but they are extremely difficult to make warm for a short time.  On the other hand, once the stones are warm, they cool down slowly.  They also are more expensive and more difficult to retrofit with heat loss mitigations, with some uncertainty about what's safe to do but also many useful case studies that show techniques that work. The key is ventilation and breatheability - it's critical not to let moisture get trapped in the building.
