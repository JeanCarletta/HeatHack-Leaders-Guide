# Activity:  Building orientation

This week's activity is a walk through the building to familiarise the group with all the spaces, and in larger buildings, agree priorities, because the group won't be able to look at everything.  

It also begins two kinds of technical data collection:  thermal monitoring and energy metering.

## Thermal monitoring

The group will want to have at least two weeks of data during the heating season for each space they will be looking at.  What happens in October can be very different from what happens during January.  Session 3 shows how to think about this kind of data in a way that many groups will then be able to pick up on themselves, since many communities contain at least someone with good numeracy skills.  There's probably only time to look at one major space during the sessions themselves, and the monitoring strategy should make sure to get enough data for that space, preferably when it's properly cold. For some groups that will be just before session 3, and for some it might be early in their sessions.  If groups are tempted to try to move the monitor around too much, it may be worth telling them they can keep their thermal monitors or buy a good commercial one for around Â£70.  

For how to choose a good location for the monitor's sensor unit and how to get it working, see the technology guide.

If the group intends to move the monitor around, they'll want to record the locations and when the move happened.  We have a template you can copy for this but you'll need to discuss who will do the moves and enter information in the diary.

## Energy metering

Energy metering is really the only way to get a handle on where energy is going, useful for assessing whether changes are working and whether there are problems controlling energy use in the building.  They are also useful for estimating the energy costs associated with different kinds of events in the building and predicting future financial requirements.

The group will want to get readings into a spreadsheet somehow and get usage converted into kWh.  We've prepared a template for this you can copy if you don't know how to do this.

You'll need to find out the best strategy for getting meter readings for this building, preferably weekly at around the same time.  Many groups will have no past information - most groups will never look at consumption on their bills, only think in terms of cost, and have a treasurer so over-stretched they understandably struggle to provide any information they have. Some groups may have recently done carbon footprint baseline measurement so have some information to hand.  Here are some suggestions of ways that have worked for other groups:

- Taking smartphone photos of the energy meters.  Because these are automatically dated and timestamped, they provide all the information you need, and sometimes there is someone (not necessarily a member of the group!) who passes the meter regularly enough that getting the photos and uploading them to something like Google Drive isn't a hassle.  The information still needs to be read off the photos, but that isn't very time-consuming.

- Using a meter log book placed next to the meter - a pen and paper approach - recording the date, time, and reading.

- Entering meter readings directly into the Google Spreadsheet

- Look at past energy bills if available. Since 2014, energy suppliers have been required by law to give historical information about annual consumption if customers ask (The Electricity and Gas (Billing) Regulations 2014) so this will be on one of the year's bills, but beware - if meter access is difficult, the meter readings could almost all be estimated, making them of little use.  

If the building has smart meters, then it's well worth discussing whether it's possible to get access to the readings, which are taken every 30 minutes.  For that, you need to know who has online access to the utility company customer accounts and look at what that company reveals to their customers.  If they don't give access to the data, your meter might be compatible with the Loop app, which retrieves the data from source on your behalf.

```{admonition} Reading meters
:class: tip

You may wonder why we aren't asking groups to read their meters on the spot.  Meters can be hard to read properly, especially older ones.  It's important to know whether gas meters are imperial (in ft3) or metric (in m3) and how to transform that into kW.  For electricity, there may be separate readings for day rates and night rates.  Without access to past bills, it may not be obvious how many meters there are, whether any are submeters, and what areas they serve.  Even just taking photos of the meters with the current readings will be an achievement for many groups.  The meter reading might be obvious when the group comes together at the end of the session, or it might be that some group member needs to take the photo away and figure out what the photo means.
