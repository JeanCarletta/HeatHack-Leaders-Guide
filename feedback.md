# Contacting us 

We are happy for you to tell us anything you think we should know, or ask us questions, at any time.  If you have feedback about the sessions and want to help us improve the programme, the easiest way is to fill in a feedback form:

- [Leader and Engineer Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelF7T0pEaX2-UD-kBIGJ9_AKjKSBzyn9gKfhPW7MJgZEvSzQ/viewform)

If you need us to fix something urgently, please just email us.

After session 3, we'd be grateful if you could ask participants to fill in the programme evaluation form.

- [Evaluation Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGzZly_GBjcgXeT5DzBLBeo0nZfshGJKYZwE87oo5QcdpHuA/viewform)

Our funder, the Royal Academy of Engineering, requires the participating engineers to fill in a form at the beginning of the programme and again at the end - the links for this will be sent by email.
