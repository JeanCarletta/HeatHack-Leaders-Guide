# Activity:  The "game"

We have produced a set of cards that the group can use to think about change.  
Groups like the tactility of cards and they help encourage everyone to participate. 
Because we think some group members and people outside the programme will be interested in the cards and their explanations, 
we've put how to use them and the explanations of the cards on a separate website.  As you use the cards, it's worth remembering 
the priorities introduced in the engineer talk - reduce demand, reduce losses, then think about generation.  It's also worth remembering
that the cards aren't perfect and that it takes professional advice to ensure the actions suit the building and how it is used.  The point of the cards
is to get people thinking, not to set a final plan in stone.

<!-- Our cards and our explanations will not be perfect, especially as in practice we have a wide range of groups and buildings signed up. They will improve over the course of the programme.  You can ask us to improve specific aspects as we go along - some of the volunteer engineers work in the building services industry and will know the answers better than we do, and we can also ask our industry and academic advisers. We expect to blog specific issues as they come up, which will give others the opportunity to comment (either publicly or privately) and to incorporate new material into the explanations as we go along. -->
