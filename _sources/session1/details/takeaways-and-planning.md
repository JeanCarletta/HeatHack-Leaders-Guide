# Takeaways and Planning

The final part of the session is about planning how to find some key sources of information, if they exist.  Some of the information, the building use diary and the heating schedule plus information about end user heating controls, is for the third session.  We ask for it now because it might take some time to get. The rest of the information is useful for session 2.  If time permits, it can be useful for the engineer to read through it so they can summarise what is already known about the building before session 2's photographic survey.
