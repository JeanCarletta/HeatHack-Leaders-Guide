# Leaders' guide

This document is a guide for the group leader and the engineer to use in running group sessions.  It gives an introduction to what sessions are like, and then detailed plans for each session that you can follow.

In this first release of the guide, session 1 is worked out in detail, and parts of the other sessions are described to give a good idea when read in conjunction with the session schedules.  

Not everything is complete or correct for sessions 2-4.  We still need to determine what goes directly on the schedules and what should be put here so there may be some redundancy.
