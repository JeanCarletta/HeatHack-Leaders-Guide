# Activity:  The "game"

We have produced a set of cards that the group can use to think about change.  Each card shows some kind of change that could be made.  There's also a wildcard to remind groups that we won't have thought of everything.  The colour of the card assigns it to a basic category, which will help when looking for our explanation behind the card.  These are given in the reading materials and include both links for the group members, often about how to understand whether the change would suit them, and technical links for the engineers that might say more about how to assess the likely effects or what kind of reasoning the professionals use.  We provide the technical links because we know some of the engineers want to learn more about the industry.

Groups like the tactility of cards and they help encourage everyone to participate. We suggest that the group leader introduce the card categories and place the cards on the table randomly where everyone can see at least some of them. It's worth reminding the group about the hierarchy introduced in the engineer talk - reduce demand, reduce losses, then think about generation.  The engineer can then suggest how to triage the cards based on what has been discovered about the building, how it is used, and the group's aspirations so far.  

Our cards and our explanations will not be perfect, especially as in practice we have a wide range of groups and buildings signed up. They will improve over the course of the programme.  You can ask us to improve specific aspects as we go along - some of the volunteer engineers work in the building services industry and will know the answers better than we do, and we can also ask our industry and academic advisers. We expect to blog specific issues as they come up, which will give others the opportunity to comment (either publicly or privately) and to incorporate new material into the explanations as we go along.
