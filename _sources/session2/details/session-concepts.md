# Engineer Talk - Session Concepts

This week's engineer talk introduces some important things to think about when choosing to make changes to a building or how it is used.  It then introduces a set of cards we have produced to help the groups think about change.  

These are this week's talking points:

- In broad terms, behavioural changes to reduce demand are the first thing to think about, followed by reducing energy waste (for instance, by reducing heat loss or using more efficient heating) and only after this by generating more energy.

:TODO:  This CSE pyramid is really badly labelled because it would be easy for readers to think that heating efficiency is about reducing demand - but that puts it before addressing heat loss, which would be the wrong way around.  What can we find that's better?

Where demand can be reduced "without loss of service", changes are usually inexpensive and don't involve buying large items like insulation and solar panels that themselves have a carbon cost - but making these kinds of changes takes understanding what people are doing in your buildings.  Session 3 has an activity that is designed to help the group think about heating controls because this is especially tricky in community buildings and has the potential to waste a large amount of energy.

:TODO: Decide whether we're withholding the cards for heating controls for session 3.

- The less a building is used, the harder it is to afford to make major building changes, not just because you don't have the income coming in to pay for it - grant funders are motivated by the community amenity and little used buildings don't present value for their limited resources.  Less use also makes it harder to justify the "embodied carbon" of building renovations.  On the other hand, heat loss isn't as great with localised heating strategies, so the really major changes aren't needed (although it's still useful to stop up draughts, keep the building dry, and everything else that affects building life and thermal comfort).  Groups have a basic choice to make before they can start to discuss changes.  This point is really just a reminder of part of session 1.

- It takes time to raise finance to make major building changes, but the planet can't wait - every tonne of carbon we save starting this year is worth more than a tonne of carbon we start saving 10 years from now.  So a good plan might well include some cheap, low carbon temporary changes followed by bigger changes down the line.  

- Changes are often assessed in terms of the payback period - how long it takes for the change to pay for itself.  The payback period is likely to be better for changes at the moment because energy prices are forecast to remain high for a while.  Community groups face a dilemma because they're usually cash poor.  It's tempting to go for the cheapest options, and sometimes that's all community groups can do, but sometimes options that are cheaper to install cost more (sometimes a lot more!) in the long run.  Some community groups have guidelines about how to make these assessments, for instance, always minimising installation costs, considering costs over 3, 10, or 25 years, or estimating the lifespan of a change and using the lifetime costs.  

- Major renovations especially to stop heat loss take careful thought and professional assessment, especially in traditional buildings.  There's a difference between someone who installs heating and heat loss solutions and a consultant who can reason about the right things to do.  Groups need to be wary of going straight to installers, because they will often be happy to sell products or install them in ways that damage the buildings - especially in traditional buildings where breatheability is important.  Community buildings will also often fail to gain the benefits they claim because they haven't thought about this kind of building and how it is used.  Professional advice is important before making major changes.  If the people supplying you with advice can't explain their reasoning, there's something wrong.

If there are obvious connections between these points and what happened in session 1, you might be able to draw that out. The questions  following the talk are a chance both for group members to ask for clarification.   This might naturally lead to a short discussion of some points and consensus on things like the group stance regarding payback periods.  If that's going to happen quickly and easily, you can let it, but we'd expect most groups to need the time between now and session 4 to mull this over.

<!-- :TODO: are any of the following points important enough?  Introducing somewhat more technical content.  I think we put these in the "points that might come up" instead.

- Things are changing quickly in the energy industry, and it's hard to predict the future - what your community will need from the building, what kinds of grants might be available with what conditions, and even what our energy sources will be.  How much we use hydrogen to replace gas or what uses of biomass are allowed long-term, for instance.
- UK policy says that almost all buildings will need to be locally net zero, not just relying on planting forests or other actions to balance them out.
