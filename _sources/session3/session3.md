# Session 3

The third session aims to determine whether your heating is adequately
and efficiently serving the users of the building. You will
consider the results of the thermal monitoring and comparing the times
that the building is warmest and coldest against the times that the
building is most occupied, and you will learn about how to best use
your heating controls.  This sounds trivial, but poor use of heating
controls is often the source of a lot of wasted energy. Having
identified issues, the group matchs them against potential solutions
identified in session two. Considering all of this, how the building
is used and what the wider community would need from the building, the group
will then work toward a list of recommendations of ways to make improvements.
