# Session 4 - Bringing it all together


Having had time to think about possible solutions, your group will
take some time to finalise the list of recommended improvements. Then,
finally, you will plan an event to involve the rest of your community
in the carrying out of your improvements.

This session is about bringing together what you have learned in the previous sessions and planning for the future.  
This week's major activity is planning for the community engagement that will test and further refine what you think 
is right for your building.

## Preparation

For this session you will need flip chart paper, pens, and sticky notes.  You'll also need to bring the results of session 3's activity.  Before 
the session you should draw the engagement models diagram on a flipchart page or otherwise find a way to display it.


## Introduction
Outline purpose of session:  to consolidate ideas, create a draft plan to put forward to the wider community, to begin planning an event to get feedback on the plan, and to talk about what is next for this group

## Activity:  Solutions into recommendations:

Leader or engineer gives an overview (no more than 10 min) of possible recommendations noted in session 3 and any prioritisation

Then open up an activity about what would the building and its use look like in 10 years time?

Using floor plans – group members add stickies with ideas

Engineer then summarises the possible recommendations

Next, group prioritises them:

-	Prioritise actions – everyone gets 5 ticks (or 5 sticky dots/stars etc) to place next to the items which are most important to them

## Activity:  event planning part 1

How can we achieve this?  How will we display the ideas?  How will we discuss, get feedback about preferences from the community

Discuss Engagement Models Diagram – :TODO: add link

To have fully empowered process, ideas ideally come from the group deliberating, but in this case we will be bringing the results of this work we have done, so more in collaboration
How can we achieve this?  How will we display the ideas?  How will we discuss, get feedback about preferences from the community

## Activity Planning part 2

All of this ideally recorded in someone’s laptop, but could be on flip charts

What is the desired outcome? Facilitator inputs – that in the constraints of this programme, it can only be presenting the plan to the wider community and getting their input

**Logistics** group to propose - Date, time, duration of event, where

**Who to invite** specifically –  5 min individual activity to record as many potential names as possible, on indivudal laptops or handwritten; hand sheets, into leader 

Move onto: idea storms, all recorded:  (whole group or split into smaller groups to report back)

**How to raise awareness**  -  before and after the more formal invite goes out, eg building manager, minister, newsletter, etc (input as to how this can happen)

**Recording of Engagement Event outcomes**, what format wil this be in?  formal report?  Video? 

Who does what by when for this engagement event plan

Esp Who will be responsible for ensuring the ‘writing up’ of this process including the outcomes gets done

Ensure actions for taking this forward outside of this group are clearly identified

**Set date** for the next event planning meeting if one is required

## Activity – what’s next?

What next for this group?  Do you want to meet again?  If so when?

We’ve worked hard together etc, is there a life for this group beyond these sessions??

## Closing:

C 1 hope I have for the future of this initiative is….

Proper closing of session, noting that the group needs to stay in touch for the event planning and implementation
